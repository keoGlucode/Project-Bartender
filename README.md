# Project-Bartender

The thing that sets apps apart is not the concept or idea. It is not how expensive or how big a team it took to complete, or even how beautiful it looks.

#It is the experience.

An app might be pretty or the idea might be cool, but if the person who uses the app does not have a great experience, chances are they won't be coming back.

So the question is: How do you build an experience?

Building a great experience requires passion, commitment and above all, care for the user. The user is central to everything we do and in the next exercise we will learn how to make build an app while focusing on the user's needs.

#What are we building??

We will be building a cocktail app for all those fancy parties you love throwing.

Even though you know the recipes by heart, to help ensure that you don't miss something you will be required to interface with the CocktailDB API.

This API has a bunch of different endpoints that you can use to retrieve information regarding cocktails. You can use any or as many of the endpoints as you like.

Tracking progress

Kanban board
We will be using a Kanban board to track our progress.

A few things to note to get the most value out of the board:
For each requirement below, you will need to have a ticket created on the board.
The creation of the ticket is going to be your responsibility
You are only allowed to work on 1 ticket at a time.
You can have multiple tickets in the Todo column, but only 1 in the In progress column at a time.
Before a new ticket can be started with, you have to move the current one into Done. 
Tickets need to at least have a title that makes sense. PUNCTUATION IS IMPORTANT - pay attention to the detail.

Standups

We will have standups every second day to talk about the progress. 
Standups will be 15 minutes in total.
